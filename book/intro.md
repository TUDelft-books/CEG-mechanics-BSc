This is a Jupyter Book containing various mechanics content for civil engineering.

1.	Model, evaluate and reflect on validity of displacements (only for cables), support reactions and internal forces in statically determinate skeletal structures and cables using equilibrium relations and virtual work (only on beam structures)
