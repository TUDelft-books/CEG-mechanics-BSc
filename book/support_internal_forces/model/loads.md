# Loads {bdg-success}`Exercise`
The direction and size of all types of loads might not be known and can be indicated indicated symbolically in which the positive direction is given by the drawn direction.

```{index} Force
:name: force
```
## Force
Forces are modelled as vectors as are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 1.3.5 and 1.3.6 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`. At Civil Engineering at Delft University of Technology the visual notation is used in most cases.

```{index} Couple
:name: couple
```
## Couple
Couples are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 3.1.4 and 3.3.3 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`. At Civil Engineering at Delft University of Technology the visual notation is used in most cases.

```{index} Distributed load
:name: q-load
```
## Distributed loads
Distributed loads are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 6.3.1 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`.

### Exercise
- If you're a TU Delft student, you can practise using the ANS exercises:
   - [<img height="12px" src="../../images/ANS.svg" alt="ANS"> exercises on distributed loads](https://ans.app/digital_test/assignments/1084563/results/new). Every time you open this link you get a new exercise. These exercises require you to be able to solve [equilibrium](../equilibrium/intro.md)
   - [<img height="12px" src="../../images/ANS.svg" alt="ANS"> exercises on support reactions with distributed loads](https://ans.app/digital_test/assignments/1084635/results/new). Every time you open this link you get a new exercise. These exercises require you to be able to solve [support reactions](../support_reactions/intro.md)
- Exercises are available in chapter 6.6 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 6 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`. These exercises require you to be able to calculate [support reactions](../support_reactions/intro.md)
