# Hinges

```{index} Hinges; rotational
```
## Rotational hinges
Rotational hinges allow rotation between connected elements. [Bending moments](bending_moment) are not transferred while [normal](normal_force) and [shear forces](shear_force) are.

Rotational hinges are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 1.3.2 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`.

```{index} Hinges: sliding
```
## Sliding hinges
Sliding hinges allow translation perpendicular to connected elements. [Shear forces](shear_force) are not transferred while [bending moments](bending_moment) and [normal forces](normal_force) are.

Sliding hinges are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 15.4.2 figure 15.17 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`.


```{index} Hinges: telescope
```
## Telescope hinges
Telescope hinges allow translation in the direction of connected elements. [Normal forces](normal_force) are not transferred while [bending moments](bending_moment) and [shear forces](shear_force) are.
