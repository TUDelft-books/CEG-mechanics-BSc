# a rigid body

This subject allows you to solve forces and moments acting on a rigid body.

## Theory

```{index} Moment; about a point
```
### Moment of a force about a point

```{index} Moment; of a couple
```
### Moment of a couple
Read chapter 3.1.4 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.


```{index} Statics; of a planar rigid body
```
### Equilibrium of a planar rigid body
Read chapter 3.2.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.

```{index} Moment; about a line
```
### Moment of a force about a line
Read chapter 3.3.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
