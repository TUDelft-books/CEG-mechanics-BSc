# ... of a body in torsion

By applying equilibrium to the free-body diagram of a body  you can find unknown torsional moment which prevent motion (rotation around own axis). The concept of equilibrium of a torsional body is treated in examples 2 and 4 in chapter 6.4 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`. At maximum one unknown force can be solved for. The steps involved are:

1. Draw a [free body diagram](free-body-diagram) of the body
2. Split the forces in convenient directions by applying [resolution of forces](resolution_forces)
3. Solve the torsional moments using ${\left. {\sum T_x } \right|_x} = 0$ for any arbitrary points $x$.
