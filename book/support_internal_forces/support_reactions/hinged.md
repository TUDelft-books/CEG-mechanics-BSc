# ... hinged structures

In a statically determinate structure, there are generally more than 3 support reactions. To find all of these, it is required to include equilibrium of [hinged parts of the structure](free_body_diagram_hinged) as well. For these parts it is known that the bending moment is $0$ at the location of the hinge, which allows you to solve an additional support reaction. Similarly as before, the forces can be solved using [equilibrium](equilibrium_body). The full procedure is shown in chapter 5.2 and 5.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
