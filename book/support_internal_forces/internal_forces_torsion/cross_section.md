To find the torsion section forces in a certain cross-section a free-body diagram has to be drawn in which the structure is cut at the point of interest. Following, the forces can be solved using [the equilibrium of a body](equilibrium_body). This is treated in chapter 10.1.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`. Typically, the sign of section forces is indicated with [deformation signs](deformation_sign). A torsional moment is either produced by a moment in the xy-plane, or a shear force excentric to the {term}`Shear force centre`.
