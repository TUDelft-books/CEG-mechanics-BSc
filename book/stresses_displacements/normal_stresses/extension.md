Extension gives a constant stress distribution:

$$\sigma^{(N)} = \frac{N}{A}$$

:::{dropdown} Note
*In a bar with homogeneous cross-section, all fibres have the same modulus
of elasticity E. If such a bar is subject to extension, the fibres are not only
subject to the same strain, but also to the same normal stress.*

This is treated in chapter 2.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
