The bending moment gives a linear stress distribution:

- $\sigma^{(M)} = \frac{M_{z}z}{I_{zz}}$

Combining with stress due to [extension](./extension.md) gives the stress formula:

- $\sigma(z) = \frac{N}{A} + \frac{M_{z}z}{I_{zz}}$

This is treated in chapter 4.4 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.

When there is bending in both the $xz$ plane and $xy$ plane the general stress formula is obtained:

- $\sigma(y,z) = \frac{N}{A} + \frac{M_{y}y}{I_{yy}} + \frac{M_{z}z}{I_{zz}}$

This is treated in chapter 4.8 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
