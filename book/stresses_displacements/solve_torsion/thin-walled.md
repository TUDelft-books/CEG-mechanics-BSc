For closed thin-walled cross sections the shear stress is defined by:

$$\tau = \frac{M_t}{2A_mt}, \quad I_t=\frac{4A_m^2}{\oint\frac{1}{t}dm}$$

For thin-walled strips the shear stress is defined by:

$$\tau = \frac{M_te_m}{\frac{1}{2}I_t}, \quad I_t=\sum_{i}\frac{1}{3}h^3 t$$

For open thin-walled cross sections the shear stress is defined by:

$$\tau = \frac{M_te_m}{\frac{1}{2}I_t}, \quad I_t=\sum_{i}\frac{1}{3}h_i t_i^3$$

This is treated in chapter 6.3 and 6.4 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
