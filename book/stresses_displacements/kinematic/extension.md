# ... for extension

The differential equation for kinematic relations for extension is based on a displaced the infinitesimal small beam:

```

leading to :

$${\epsilon} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}u}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 2.2.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.

## Exercises
- Exercises in chapter 2.9 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`, answers are available on [this website](https://icozct.tudelft.nl/TUD_CT/bookanswers/vol2/Chapter2/): 2.47 - 2.50. This requires insight into [constitutive](constitutive_eq) and [equilibrium relations](ode_equilibrium) too.
