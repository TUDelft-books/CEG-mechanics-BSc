# ... for bending

The differential equation for kinematic relations for bending is based on a displaced the infinitesimal small beam:

```

leading to :

$${\varphi} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}w}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

and

```{figure} bending_data/drawing2.svg
:align: center
```

leading to :

$${\kappa} =  \frac{{{\rm{d}}\varphi}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 4.3.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.

## Exercises
- Exercises in chapter 8.6 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`, answers are available on [this website](https://icozct.tudelft.nl/TUD_CT/bookanswers/vol2/Chapter2/): 8.5 - 8.11. This requires insight into [constitutive](constitutive_eq) and [equilibrium relations](ode_equilibrium) too.
