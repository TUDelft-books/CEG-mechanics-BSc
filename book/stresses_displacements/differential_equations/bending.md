# ... for bending

$$-EI\frac{d^4w}{dz^4}+q_z = 0$$

The differential equation for extension is obtained by combining the [kinematic](../kinematic/bending.md), [constitutive](../constitutive/bending.md) and [static](../../support_internal_forces/ode/bending.md) relationships for extension.

This is treated in chapter 4.11 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
