# ... for extension

$$EA\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}+q_x = 0$$

The differential equation for extension is obtained by combining the [kinematic](../kinematic/extension.md), [constitutive](../constitutive/extension.md) and [static](../../support_internal_forces/ode/extension.md) relationships for extension.

This is treated in chapter 2.5 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
