## Longitudinal shear stresses

The shear force per unit length in the longitudinal direction is given by:

$$s_x^a = -\frac{dM_z}{dx} \frac{S_z^a}{I_{zz}} = -\frac{V_zS_z^a}{I_{zz}}$$

The shear stress is given by:

$$\sigma_{mx} = \frac{s_x^a}{b^a}$$

This is treated in chapter 5.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.

## Cross-sectional shear stresses
To define the cross-sectional shear stresses, the following definition is used:

```{glossary}
Perpendicular shear stresses
  The shear stresses in two perpendicular planes are equal, and their directions are such that either the arrowheads or the tails are pointed to one another.
```
$$\sigma_{xm} = \frac{s_x^a}{b^a}$$

This is treated in chapter 5.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
