- You can calculate buckling forces of skeletal structures
- You can calculate stress conditions for multiple failure criteria
- You can calculate support reactions, internal forces and displacements of skeletal structures using work and energy methods
- You can calculate influence lines for beam structures
- You can calculate stresses and deformations for inhomogeneous or asymmetrical cross-sections
- You can apply plastic failure analysis on skeletal structues
