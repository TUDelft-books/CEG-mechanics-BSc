# Composition and resolution of forces

The composition and resolution of forces works both for planar forces (at least one of $R_x$, $R_y$ or $R_z$ equals $0$), and forces in 3-dimensional space.

## Theory

Forces can be composed both analytically and graphically. The graphical approach can be a quick check for the analytical solution and allows the use of trigonometry.

### Composition of forces analytically
Read chapter 2.1.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
The components of the resultant force can be found by:
```{math}
:label: Components_resulting_force
\eqalign{
  & {R_x} = \sum {{F_x}}   \cr 
  & {R_y} = \sum {{F_y}}   \cr 
  & {R_z} = \sum {{F_z}}  \cr} 
```

The resulting force itself is:
```{math}
:label: squaring_resulting_force
R = \sqrt {{R_x}^2 + {R_y}^2 + {R_z}^2}
```

with direction $\alpha$:
```{math}
:label: direction_resulting_force
\eqalign{
  & \cos \left( {{\alpha _x}} \right) = {{{R_x}} \over R}  \cr 
  & \cos \left( {{\alpha _y}} \right) = {{{R_y}} \over R}  \cr 
  & \cos \left( {{\alpha _z}} \right) = {{{R_z}} \over R} \cr} 
```

### Composition of forces graphically
Read chapter 2.1.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.

```{index} Resolution of forces
```
### Resolution of forces analytically
Read chapter 2.1.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.

### Resolution of forces graphically
Read chapter 2.1.4 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
